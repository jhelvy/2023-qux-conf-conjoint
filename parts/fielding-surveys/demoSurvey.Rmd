# Welcome to our survey!

This is a demo of a survey using https://formr.org/

---

1) Do you like fruit?

- Yes!
- Kind of
- No :(

2) What is your favorite fruit?

[open text response]

3) In what year were you born?

(Drop down menu including `Prefer not to say` and years `1920` - `2003`)

---

Before we go on, please select which color you prefer between these two:

- Blue
- Red

Note that if you want to load some data or insert an image, these need to be available somewhere on the web. For example, here I'm reading in [this data](https://github.com/jhelvy/charts/blob/master/climateChangeBarcode/data/noaa_global_data.csv) from GitHub: 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emse-eda-gwu/2021-Spring/master/data/nasa_global_temps.csv"
data <- read_csv(url)
```

Now I can use this data to do something, like make a chart:

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = meanTemp)) +  
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(
    x = "Year", 
    y = "Temperature Anomaly (C)",
    caption = "Data Source: NASA"
  )
```

---

If I try to use the `data` object on this page, the survey will error. 

Instead, I'll need to read in the data again

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emse-eda-gwu/2021-Spring/master/data/nasa_global_temps.csv"
data <- read_csv(url)

data2020 <- data %>% 
  filter(year == 2020)
```

The temperature anomaly in 2020 was `r data2020$meanTemp` degrees Celsius.

Here's an image of a cute penguin :)
