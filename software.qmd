# Workshop Software & Code

1. Download and unzip [this code](practice/2023-qux-conf-conjoint.zip) for the practice sessions.

2. Install the latest version of R and RStudio:

- [Download and install R](https://cloud.r-project.org) (version 4.0.2 or higher)
- [Download and install RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (Desktop version)

3. Open RStudio and run this code to install the packages we'll be using:

```{r}
#| eval: false

install.packages('logitr')
install.packages('cbcTools')
```

4. As a backup, sign up for [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/plans/free)^["Posit" is the company that makes "RStudio", the software we'll use to work with R.] (the free version). It's basically the same thing as RStudio, but accessible via a web browser. If things aren't working on your computer, this is a great backup to quickly get back to working in RStudio.

That's it - you're all set!
